# Advent of Code 2019 Solutions in Haskell

- [x] **Day 1.1**: calculate total fuel required for all modules of space craft based on mass
- [x] **Day 1.2**: extend Day 1.1 to include fuel for fuel (and so on)
- [x] **Day 2.1**: create Intcode program
- [x] **Day 2.2**: find pair producing output of 19690720
- [x] **Day 3.1**: fix fuel management system: determine Manhattan distance from central port to closest intersection
- [x] **Day 3.2**: minimize signal delay: fewest combined steps wires take to intersection
- [x] **Day 4.1**: determine no. of passwords in range 248345-746315 meeting given criteria to total of 1019
- [x] **Day 4.2**: as previous, with additional predicate, resulting 660 passwords
- [ ] **Day 5.1**: diagnostic program of Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal (TEST)
