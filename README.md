# Advent of Code 2019 Solutions in Haskell

- [x] **Day 1.1**: calculate total fuel required for all modules of space craft based on mass
- [x] **Day 1.2**: extend Day 1.1 to include fuel for fuel (and so on)
- [x] **Day 2.1**: create Intcode program
- [x] **Day 2.2**: find pair producing output of 19690720
- [x] **Day 3.1**: fix fuel management system: determine Manhattan distance from central port to closest intersection
- [x] **Day 3.2**: minimize signal delay: fewest combined steps wires take to intersection
- [x] **Day 4.1**: determine no. of passwords in range 248345-746315 meeting given criteria to total of 1019
- [x] **Day 4.2**: as previous, with additional predicate, resulting 660 passwords
- [x] **Day 5.1**: implement parser of diagnostic program of Thermal Environment Supervision Terminal (TEST) to result all outputs to 0 and diagnostic code to 9025675
- [x] **Day 5.2**: extend TEST to thermal radiators, op codes 5, 6, 7, 8 and to return program the only output of diagnostic code 11981754
- [x] **Day 6.1**: determine orbit count checksum that is total no. of direct orbits and indirect orbits of 234446
- [x] **Day 6.2**: determine minimum no. of orbital transfers for "SAN" and "YOU" to meet to 385
